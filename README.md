# antlr-pglang-demo #

This is the demo for the made-up programming language interpreter using ANTLR. I found this code useful as an example for other developers experiencing some difficulties in implementation of ANTLR4 parser.

## Getting started ##

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Run the developer server...

```bash
npm run serve
```

...or build a static bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

For now the page has only the plain text area and the button to parse the code. In order to see some runtime results you can write the function `print(something)`, the result will be in the browser console. More functions and other improvements coming soon.

## To-do ##

* Describe the project structure and how it works

* Describe the language grammar

* Add more syntactic constructions in ANTLR grammar

* Not to give it all up because of my horrible laziness
